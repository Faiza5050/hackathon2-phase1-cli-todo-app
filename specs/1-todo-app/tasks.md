/sp.tasks Phase-1 Todo In-Memory Python Console App

Goal:
Break the approved plan into small, executable tasks suitable for agentic implementation.

Tasks:

1. Project setup
   - Initialize Python project structure
   - Configure UV environment
   - Verify Python 3.13+ runtime

2. Task data model
   - Define in-memory representation for a todo item
   - Include id, title, completion status

3. In-memory task store
   - Create data structure to hold tasks
   - Implement add and retrieve operations

4. Core operations
   - Add new task
   - View all tasks
   - Update existing task
   - Delete task
   - Mark task as complete

5. Command-line interface
   - Display menu options
   - Capture and validate user input
   - Route commands to task operations

6. Application flow
   - Implement main loop
   - Handle empty states and invalid inputs gracefully

7. Validation
   - Manual testing of all commands
   - Verify success criteria from specification

Completion definition:
- All basic-level features work in a single console session
- No persistence beyond runtime
- Clean output and predictable behavior
